    <h1>Refuge Ranch Redesign</h1>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      In a team of 4 designers, we chose a local non-profit website to redesign.
      We executed a high-fidelity responsive web redesign solution through a
      clickable prototype and utilized our skills gained in both UX and UI
      design. The non-profit we chose was Refuge Ranch Ministries which is an
      organization that rescues horses and provies equine therapy for at-risk
      youth.
    </p>
    <h4>Timeline</h4>
    <p>3 weeks</p>
    <h4>Role</h4>
    <p>
      As a team our roles were user research and usability testing, ideation and
      brainstorming, prototyping, the final presentation. We worked together on
      the design and I specifically worked on the mobile version of our site.
    </p>
    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <p>
      User research, user interviews, defining the problem, ideation and
      brainstorming,information architecure, UI prototyping, UI style guise
      design, UI testing and final group presentation.
    </p>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>Figma, Miro, Canva, Google Drive, Pen and Paper and Zoom.</p>
    <h4>Current website</h4>
    <p>
      Our team decided on Refuge Ranch Ministries website to redesign because we
      admired the organizations overall mission and our shared appeciation of
      horses. However, we found that the website was outdated, lacked
      accessibility and its design and information architecure needed
      improvement.

    <h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
      Parents and guardians need alternative therapy methods in a safe
      environment to improve their children's mental health because of the
      current mental health crisis among youth.
    </p>
    <h4>User Insight</h4>
    <p>
      Parents and guardians need complete and trustworthy information, so they
      feel safe with their children/child participating in Refuge Ranch
      Ministries programs and services.
    </p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <h4>User Interviews</h4>
    <p>
      We each interviewed 1 person, 4 in total to gain insight on people’s views
      on the Refuge Ranch Ministries website and how they feel about alternative
      forms of therapy particularly equine therapy. These are some of the things
      we heard during our interviews:
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
        "I would not have immediately known what the purpose of the website was
        until you told me. The information was difficult to find and the website
        is really bad."
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
        "[The website] is not very professional looking so I would probably look
        for another option..."
      </div>

      <!-- Force next columns to break to new line at md breakpoint and up -->
      <div class="w-100 d-none d-md-block"></div>
      <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
        "Yes I think horse therapy is a great idea, horses are intelligent, calm
        and nurturing."
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
        "I do think animal therapy is a valid method. The connections with the
        animals is important and the ability to put the needs another living
        thing above yourself really shifts perspective."
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Surveys</h4>
    <p>
      We also conducted a survey to gain insight on parents views on equine
      therapy, mental health among youth and alternative forms of therapy. These
      are some of the results we found important from our survey.

    <h3>Information Architecure</h3>
    <h4>User Flow</h4>
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="cardContainer col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-12">
          <div class="card" style="width: 18rem">
            <img
              src="./images/user flow old.png"
              class="card-img-top"
              alt="Photo of the websites current user flow"
            />
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Current User Flow</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="cardContainer col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-12">
          <div class="card" style="width: 18rem">
            <img
              src="./images/User Flow new.png"
              class="card-img-top"
              alt="Photo of our new user flow"
            />
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Redesigned User Flow</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      For our user flow, we wanted the navigation to be easy to understand. A
      user might not know that “Mentor the Child” is where you would sign up
      your child. We did not want any confusion in our redesign.
