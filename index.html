      <h1>Refuge Ranch Redesign</h1>
      <h4 class="mt-5">Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        In a team of 4 designers, we chose a local non-profit website to
        redesign. We executed a high-fidelity responsive web redesign solution
        through a clickable prototype and utilized our skills gained in both UX
        and UI design. The non-profit we chose was Refuge Ranch Ministries which
        is an organization that rescues horses and provies equine therapy for
        at-risk youth.
      </p>
      <h5>Timeline</h5>
      <p>3 weeks</p>
      <h5>Role</h5>
      <p>
        As a team our roles were user research and usability testing, ideation
        and brainstorming, prototyping, the final presentation. We worked
        together on the design and I specifically worked on the mobile version
        of our site.
      </p>
      <h5>Deliverables</h5>
      <p>
        User research, user interviews, defining the problem, ideation and
        brainstorming,information architecure, UI prototyping, UI style guise
        design, UI testing and final group presentation.
      </p>
      <h5>Tools</h5>
      <p>Figma, Miro, Canva, Google Drive, Pen and Paper and Zoom.</p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h4>Current website</h4>
      <p>
        Our team decided on Refuge Ranch Ministries website to redesign because
        we admired the organizations overall mission and our shared appeciation
        of horses. However, we found that the website was outdated, lacked
        accessibility and its design and information architecure needed
        improvement.

      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>
        Parents and guardians need alternative therapy methods in a safe
        environment to improve their children's mental health because of the
        current mental health crisis among youth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>User Insight</h4>
      <p>
        Parents and guardians need complete and trustworthy information, so they
        feel safe with their children/child participating in Refuge Ranch
        Ministries programs and services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h4>User Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        We each interviewed 1 person, 4 in total to gain insight on people’s
        views on the Refuge Ranch Ministries website and how they feel about
        alternative forms of therapy particularly equine therapy. These are some
        of the things we heard during our interviews:
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
          "I would not have immediately known what the purpose of the website
          was until you told me. The information was difficult to find and the
          website is really bad."
        </div>

        <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
          "[The website] is not very professional looking so I would probably
          look for another option..."
        </div>

        <div class="w-100 d-none d-md-block"></div>

        <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
          "Yes I think horse therapy is a great idea, horses are intelligent,
          calm and nurturing."
        </div>

        <div class="col-6 col-sm-4">
          "I do think animal therapy is a valid method. The connections with the
          animals is important and the ability to put the needs another living
          thing above yourself really shifts perspective."
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Surveys</h4>
      <p>
        We also conducted a survey to gain insight on parents views on equine
        therapy, mental health among youth and alternative forms of therapy.
        These are some of the results we found important from our survey.

        your child. We did not want any confusion in our redesign.

      <h4>Usability Tests</h4>
      <p>
        We each conducted usability tests to make iterations on each version of
        our prototypes. We listened to the feedback and made changes to our
        final prototype. Some of the feedback we received was:
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm">
            "The header background color and the menu options color needs more
            contrast.”
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm">
            "It seems somewhat unclear if or when the sign up process is
            finalized, and it feels like it should maybe be a 'get more info'
            page."
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm">
            "As a non-profit website, the donate button needs to stand out
            against the other buttons."
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Style Guide</h4>
      <p>
        For our style guide we wanted to update the colors and text. We chose
        earth tones to represent the look and feel of a horse ranch. We updated
        the logo, buttons and the search bar. Our ideal user would be a
        parent/guardian wanting to sign up a child for sessions and we wanted
        the site to feel trustworthy to them.
      </p>
      <img

        class="hifiMobile"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        In conclusion, we wanted our design to represent the beauty of Refuge
        Ranch Ministries inside and out. We wanted to update the design to an
        adult friendly site and create an effortless navigation. Our ultimate
        goal was to create a trustworthy website that would represent the
        mission of the organization.
